title: "iPhone Developer Program: Resetting your 100 device-per-year limit"
---

From [https://developer.apple.com/support/ios/program-renewals.html](https://developer.apple.com/support/ios/program-renewals.html)
 - one to watch out for when you renew your iPhone Developer Program membership:

<blockquote>When Team Agents or Admins first log into the iOS Provisioning Portal at the start of a new membership year, they will be presented with the option to remove devices and restore the device count for those removed devices. <strong>Important Note: Devices can be removed and their device count restored only up until the first new device is added.</strong> Therefore, it is important to remove all devices you are no longer using for development prior to adding any new devices.</blockquote>
